# Tilefin-DX

A custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image built on [Universal Blue](https://github.com/ublue-os)'s [base-nvidia](https://github.com/ublue-os/main), providing the [Niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri) tiling compositor for a keyboard-driven [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) desktop with Nvidia GPU support.

## Opinionated Defaults

| Choice | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **base-nvidia base** | Minimal base with Nvidia drivers. No GNOME, Homebrew, Docker, or other packages to strip. Every installed package is an explicit choice. |
| **Niri compositor** | Scrollable tiling, clean fractional scaling, official Fedora package. |
| **Wayland-only** | No XWayland/X11. Future-forward graphics stack. Apps that don't support Wayland won't work. |
| **Tools in containers** | CLI tools live in a distrobox userbox, not the system image. Image updates and tool updates are independent. |
| **Minimal notifications** | Mako runs invisibly by default. A waybar indicator shows when notifications exist. No toasts stealing focus. |
| **Focus-follows-mouse** | Enabled in Niri. Keyboard navigation still works independently. |

## Project Goals

1. **Reproducibility**: Immutable system image with explicit, auditable package choices
2. **Reliability**: Stable tiling window manager that works consistently
3. **Visual Quality**: Proper high-DPI support and modern aesthetics
4. **Nvidia Compatibility**: Full GPU support for Nvidia hardware
5. **Keyboard-Driven**: Efficient tiling window management
6. **Clean separation**: OS image for session infrastructure, distrobox for user tools

## Key Features

### Excellent High-DPI Support
Niri provides clean fractional scaling without the pixel-repetition artifacts seen in some other compositors such as Hyprland. Proper `wp-fractional-scale-v1` protocol support ensures crisp text and UI elements on modern displays.

### Scrollable Tiling
Niri's unique scrollable/infinite canvas workflow - windows tile horizontally and you scroll through them, rather than cramming everything onto a fixed screen. Great for ultrawide monitors and focus-oriented workflows.

## What This Image Provides

The base image (`base-nvidia:gts`) provides Fedora, Nvidia open kernel modules, Podman, distrobox, just/ujust, Flatpak with Flathub, and media codecs. It ships no desktop environment. This image adds:

### Wayland Desktop Environment
- **Status Bar**: Waybar
- **Application Launcher**: Fuzzel
- **Terminal**: Ptyxis (GTK4, GPU-accelerated, native container integration)
- **Lock Screen**: Hyprlock
- **Idle Management**: hypridle
- **Notifications**: Mako
- **Screenshots**: Grim and Slurp
- **Screen Recording**: wf-recorder
- **Wallpaper**: swww
- **File Manager**: Thunar
- **Display Management**: wdisplays
- **Utilities**: wl-clipboard, cliphist, pamixer, brightnessctl

### Display Manager
- Uses **greetd** with **tuigreet** instead of GDM
- Remembers your last session choice
- Properly configured for OSTree-based systems using sysusers.d and tmpfiles.d
- Full Nvidia environment variables configured

### Theming
- Default GTK theme set to **adw-gtk3-dark** for both GTK 3 and GTK 4
- Dark theme preference enabled by default
- Configuration applied via `/etc/skel` for all new users

### System Configuration
- **Polkit agent**: lxpolkit configured to autostart with the compositor
- **Portals**: xdg-desktop-portal-gtk for proper Wayland integration
- **Input settings**:
  - Caps Lock remapped to Control
  - Natural scrolling enabled for touchpads
  - Custom keyboard and mouse configuration
- **Podman socket**: Enabled by default
- **Layout**: Master-stack layout configured as default
- **Nvidia optimizations**: Full environment variable configuration for optimal GPU performance

## Identified Requirements

Based on the current setup, any replacement compositor must support:

### Core Requirements
- **Nvidia GPU compatibility**: Must work with proprietary Nvidia drivers
- **Wayland-only**: Pure Wayland, no XWayland/X11 compatibility (X11-only apps will not work)
- **HiDPI scaling**: Proper fractional scaling and readable text/UI elements
- **OSTree compatibility**: Works with immutable/atomic OS structure

### Integration Requirements
- **Display Manager**: Works with greetd/tuigreet ✓
- **Desktop Portals**: Compatible with xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ✓
- **Session Management**: Launched via Wayland session files ✓
- **Polkit Integration**: Supports polkit agents for privilege escalation ✓

### User Experience
- **Tiling Management**: Automatic window tiling with keyboard controls
- **Multi-monitor**: Robust multi-display support
- **Configuration**: Declarative config files (no GUI-only settings)
- **Input Remapping**: Custom keyboard layouts (e.g., Caps→Ctrl)

### Development Workflow
- VS Code (host application, attaches to containers)
- Container tooling (Podman, distrobox — from base image)
- Fish shell
- Full KVM/QEMU/libvirt virtualization stack with Looking Glass

## Installation

From any bootc-based system:

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/repentsinner/tiled-bluefin-dx-nvidia-open
sudo reboot
```

## Post-Installation Setup

### WireGuard VPN

WireGuard tools are pre-installed. Configure VPN connections via NetworkManager:
- Use `nmcli` for CLI configuration
- Or install `nm-connection-editor` for GUI setup

WireGuard status can be monitored via NetworkManager.

### Userbox (CLI Tools)

CLI tools (`gh`, `chezmoi`, `direnv`, `zoxide`, `starship`, `eza`,
`bws`) live in a pre-built distrobox container, not in the system image.
A default distrobox declaration ships via `/etc/skel/`, so every new
user account has one ready.

First boot:

```bash
ujust setup-userbox
```

This assembles the container and exports binaries to `~/.local/bin`.
To use a different image:

```bash
ujust setup-userbox ghcr.io/youruser/yourbox:latest
```

After the userbox is running, bootstrap chezmoi for dotfiles and
auto-assembly on future logins:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply <your-dotfiles-repo>
```

The chezmoi-managed systemd unit reassembles the userbox on each login.
After `chezmoi apply`, the process is self-sustaining.

## Configuration

### Niri
Customize by editing `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`. See the [Niri wiki](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki) for configuration options.

## Package Management

On an immutable system, software belongs in the right layer:

| Method | For | Example |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **System image** | Session infrastructure, system services | Niri, greetd, libvirt |
| **Flatpak** | Sandboxed GUI apps | `flatpak install --user flathub org.mozilla.firefox` |
| **Distrobox** | CLI tools, dev toolchains, language runtimes | Userbox (see below), or `distrobox create --image fedora:latest` |
| **Native installer** | Vendor-provided self-updating CLIs | `claude install` to `~/.local/bin` |

ujust recipes are baked into the system image (`/usr/share/ublue-os/just/`). They update when the OS image updates via bootc. Run `ujust --list` to see available recipes.

## Compositor Migration History

This project has evolved through several compositors seeking the best HiDPI and tiling experience:

### Sway → Hyprland
Sway lacks `wp-fractional-scale-v1` support, limiting it to integer-only scaling (1x, 2x). This is unusable on modern HiDPI displays where users need 1.25x or 1.5x scaling.

### Hyprland → Niri (Current Default)
While Hyprland solved the fractional scaling protocol support, it has two significant issues:

1. **Scaling artifacts** - visible as repeated columns/rows of pixels at certain fractional scale factors
2. **Recursive splitting layout** - Hyprland's default tiling algorithm continuously subdivides columns for new windows, making layouts with more than 2-3 windows impractical (each window becomes a sliver)

Niri resolves both issues with cleaner fractional scaling and a scrollable horizontal layout that doesn't degrade with window count.

Hyprland has been removed from this image. Niri is the sole compositor.
